    <h1>Quick Sort</h1>

    <p>So if mergeSort achieves the best possible time complexity (O(n log n)), why do we have other sorting algorithms?
    </p>

    <p>Like mergeSort, we split up the arrays until they contain only O or 1 element. From there we select an element
        called the pivot, and we move all of the numbers lower than that to the left, and the numbers larger to the
        right. Only the pivot then is in the 'correct spot'</p>

    <p>After that, we move the pivot to the left side and then the right side.</p>

    <p>The pivot does alter the runtime of quick sort. Ideally, the pivot should be chosen so that it's roughly the
        median value in the data set you're sorting. But because the data is not sorted (duh), we probably don't know
        the median value.</p>

    <p>For simplicity, we are gonna pick the first element. This is fine, but not optimal. Works horribly if the data is
        already sorted.</p>

    <p>Same time complexity as mergeSort of O(n log n). Splitting the array into sub arrays of 1 and 0 elements can be
        done in O(log n) time, then comparing the elements one time through is O(n).</p>
