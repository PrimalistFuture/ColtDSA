    <h1>Doubly Linked List</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>Damn similar structurally, but now each node, instead of containing only information about the next node, also
        contains information about the previous node. Has a large impact of the code we could write for the methods, and
        the effeciency of those methods.</p>

    <p>The code will be more complicated, because each node contains more information. The real drawback of DLL is that
        it takes more memory to store the additional information.</p>

    <h2>Big O</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Insertion - O(1)</li>
        <li>Removal - O(1), this is the big benefit of a DLL vs a SLL</li>
        <li>Searching - O(N) - optimized to be quicker than SLL, but still technically O(N)</li>
        <li>Access - O(N)</li>
    </ul>
