    <h1>Intro to Heaps</h1>

    <p>Heaps are another category of trees. But they have some special rules. We will mostly be focusing on Binary
        Heaps, of which there are two variations.</p>

    <p>In a <b>MaxBinaryHeap</b> parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a <b>MinBinaryHeap</b>, parent
        nodes are always smaller than child nodes.</p>

    <p>Binary Heaps are used to implement <b>Priority Queues</b>, which are very commonly used data structures. Heaps
        are also used quite a bit with graph traversal algorithms.</p>

    <h2>Max Binary Heap</h2>

    <p>In a Max, the root node will always be the largest node. But there is no realationship between the left side of
        the heap and right side of the heap like there is in a Binary Search Tree.</p>

    <p>Each parent has at most two child nodes. The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes.
        The parent is greater than the children, but there is no guarantees between sibling nodes. THAT IS - the
        children of a given parent are never compared to each other. A binary heap is as
        compact as possible. <b>All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled
            out first.</b></p>

    <h2>Storing Heaps</h2>

    <p>The easiest way of storing a binary heap is an array. But in an array it would be hard to know what a given nodes
        child nodes are... unless you know that there is a math formula to figure out it</p>

    <p>For a given index in the array, n, the <b>left child is stored at 2n + 1, and the right child is stored at 2n +
            2.</b> So if a node is at index 2, its children would be at index 5 and 6.</p>

    <p>Similarly, if you have a child node and want to know its parent, you can (n-1) / 2 and round down if necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>Priority Queue Intro</h2>

    <p>A <b>priority queue</b> is a data structure where each element has a priority associated with it. Elements with
        higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.</p>

    <p>Priority queues can be implemented with a variety of data structures. It can be a simple list of objects. But I
        heap is a very good implementation.</p>

    <h2>Big O</h2>

    <p>Insertion and Deletion of a binary heap is O(log n). Because each time we go down a generation, we have 2x the
        number of nodes. But we are only comparing a node to its parent. For 16 elements in the binary heap, we would
        only have to make 4 comparisons.</p>

    <p>Binary Heaps are not really made to be searchable effeciently, searching has an O(n) time. A given node could
        really be just about anywhere.</p>
