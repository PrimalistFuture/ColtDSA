    <h1>Insertion Sort</h1>

    <p>Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted. So each element is placed
        into order as the sort is building.</p>

    <p>Does this by looking before an item.</p>

    <p>Worst case scenario, insertion sort is O(n^2). Data that is reversed is horrible for insertion sort.</p>

    <p>If the data is nearly sorted, than it could be much better. It is also very good at sorting data that is coming
        in live. Because numbers are sorted one at a time, it doesn't matter that we don't have all of the info right
        away.</p>
