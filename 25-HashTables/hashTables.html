    <h1>Hash Tables</h1>

    <p>Sometimes called Hash Maps. Like lists, just about every language has a hash table implementation built into it.
        We will make our own, but really there is no reason to reinvent the wheel. </p>

    <h2>What is a Hash Table</h2>

    <p>Hash tables store key-value pairs. The keys of the hash table are not ordered. They are extremely quick for
        finding values, adding new values and removing values. Hash tables are built ontop of arrays, allowing for that
        fast lookup array[1], but without an order.</p>

    <p>Even though every language has a hash table, it is still good to know how they are implemented.</p>

    <p>The keys of a hash table don't have to be strings, but many implementations require them to be strings.</p>

    <h2>Hashing</h2>

    <p>In order to look up values by a given key, we need a way to convert that key into a valid array index. The
        functions that help us do that conversion are called hash functions. They are all over the place and you don't
        really ever need to write your own.</p>

    <p>The idea of a hash function is that if we pass it a string, the function will output the same number everytime.
    </p>

    <p>So if we pass it 'pink', it will give us back 0. And 'red' will give us 8 or whatever. The keys and values are
        then stored in that array index.</p>

    <p>Hash functions are often one-way: the output it gives you can not be reversed to figure out what the initial key
        was.</p>

    <p>Hash functions need to be fast O(1), distributes things uniformally and don't collide, and stable so the same
        input gives the same output everytime.</p>
