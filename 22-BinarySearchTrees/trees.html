    <h1>Trees</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>A <b>tree</b> is a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent / child relationship. So one node might
        connect to
        several other nodes, but only ever has one parent. Child nodes cannot point to siblings or whatever. Every node
        must be moving 'away' from the root node.</p>

    <p>Trees must only ever have one 'root' node, the very top of the tree. A 'leaf' node is one that has no children. A
        <b>edge</b> is the connection between one node and another.
    </p>

    <p>Trees then are <b>nonlinear</b> - you can have more than one path through the data structure.</p>

    <p>A Singly Linked List is sort of a special case of tree, one that is entirely linear.</p>

    <h3>Uses for trees</h3>

    <p>The HTML Document Object Model is a tree. Elements are nested all of the way down from a single root. Apparently
        network routing makes heavy use of trees as well. AI makes heavy use of trees as well. Folders of your Operating
        System are trees.</p>

    <h3>Binary Trees</h3>

    <p>These are special trees in which any given parent only have a max of two children. </p>

    <h3>Binary Search Trees</h3>

    <p>A special type of binary tree, binary search trees are sorted in a way in which the 'middle' value node is the
        root node. So for a number set, 3 would be the root node of 1,2,3,4,5. And every node to the left of a parent
        node is always less than the parent. The greater nodes are the righter of the child nodes. </p>

    <p>This methodology makes it very easy to insert new data and to search for a specific value.</p>
