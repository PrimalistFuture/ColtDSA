    <h1>Comparing Elementary Sorting Algorithms</h1>

    <p>In the grand scheme, these three are pretty close to each other in most scenarios. For small data sets, they are
        pretty reasonable. Slow down a lot when the data gets larger. To get faster, we need far more complex
        algorithms.</p>

    <p>Both Bubble and Insertion sort are good at nearly sorted data. Whereas Selection is very bad at that.</p>

    <p>All three of these are great when it comes to Space Complexity. They take more time, but they don't write many
        variables or create new arrays.</p>

    <p>Insertion is great if data is streaming in.</p>
