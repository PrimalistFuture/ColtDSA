    <h1>Dynamic Programming</h1>

    <p>Dynamic Programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler
        subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.</p>

    <p>Dynamic Programming isn't for every problem, but when it works, it can really speed things up.</p>

    <p>The name itself is a little misleading and infact wasn't defined with computers in mind. It isn't trying to work
        on a million inputs - it just sounds that way.</p>

    <p>Dynamic Programming really only works on problems with <b>optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Overlapping Subproblems</h2>

    <p>A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if <b>it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused
            several times.</b></p>

    <p>So there needs to be a repetition and they need to overlap. Something like mergesort, which breaks down problems
        and then rebuilds them would NOT be overlapping enough to work with dynamic programming.</p>

    <h2>Optimal substructure</h2>

    <p>A problem is said to have optimal substructure if <b>an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal
            solutions of its subproblems.</b>
    </p>

    <p>Things like shortest path are NOT optimal substruture because the cheapest flight to SEA might not be included in
        the cheapest flight to Fairbanks.
    </p>

    <h2>Memoization</h2>

    <p>A key part of Dynamic programming is using past knowledge to make solving a future problem easier.</p>

    <p><b>Memoization</b> is storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the
        same inputs occur again.
    </p>

    <p>Check out the demo. Makes a huge difference. Gets down to O(n) time.</p>

    <h2>Tabulation</h2>

    <p><b>Tabulation</b> is storing the result of a previous result in a 'table', usually an array. Usually done with
        iteration and has better space complexity than memoization. This is the 'bottom up' type approach.</p>

    <p>Because Tabulation is iterative, it won't run into a stack overflow error like a recursive, memoized function
        might.</p>
