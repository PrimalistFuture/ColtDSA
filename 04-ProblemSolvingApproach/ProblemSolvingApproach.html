    <h1>Problem Solving Patterns</h1>

    <h2>Problem Solving Strategies</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Explore Concrete Examples</li>
        <li>Break it Down</li>
        <li>Solve/Simplify</li>
        <li>Look Back and Refactor</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 1 - Understanding the Problem</h2>

    <p>Before you start typing, ask clarifying questions from the interviewer. Things like: <b>"Can you restate the
            problem in your own words?" "What are the inputs that go into the problem?" "What are the outputs that
            should come from the solution?" "Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?" "How should I label the
            important pieces of data that are part of the problem?" </b></p>

    <p>CTD.</p>

    <h2>Step 2 - Concrete Examples</h2>

    <p>Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better. Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should.</p>

    <p>Start simple. Than more complex. Empty inputs. Invalid inputs. CTD.</p>

    <h2>Step 3 - Break it Down</h2>

    <p>Doesn't have to be full pseudocode yet, but jot down the steps and communicate right away.</p>

    <P>CTD.</P>

    <h2>Step 4 - Solve / Simplify</h2>

    <p>If you are stuck on a really tricky bit, it can be useful to solve a simpler version of the problem.</p>

    <h2>Step 5 - Refactor</h2>
