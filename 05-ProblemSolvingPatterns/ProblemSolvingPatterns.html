    <h1>Problem Solving Patterns</h1>

    <p>This section is about mastering common problem solving patterns. Not exhaustive whatsoever.</p>

    <h2>Frequency Counter Pattern</h2>

    <p>Uses objects or sets to collect values / frequencies of values. Can often avoid the need for nested loops or
        O(n^2) operations with arrays and strings. CTD.</p>

    <h2>Multiple Pointers</h2>

    <p>Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, middle or end
        based on a certain condition. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.</p>

    <p>CTD. Very cool stuff.</p>

    <h2>Sliding Window Pattern</h2>

    <p>This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another.
        Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created). Very
        usefult for keeping track of a subset of data in an array / string / whatever.</p>

    <h2>Divide and Conquer</h2>

    <p>This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.
        Tremendously decreases time complexity when done on the right problem.</p>
    <p>Meaning, the data set almost always must be pre-sorted for this divide and conquer to be the right approach.</p>
    <p>This is essentially Binary Search (yay...)</p>
