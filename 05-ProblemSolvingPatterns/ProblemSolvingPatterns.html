    <h1>Problem Solving Patterns</h1>

    <p>This section is about mastering common problem solving patterns. Not exhaustive whatsoever.</p>

    <h2>Frequency Counter Pattern</h2>

    <p>Uses objects or sets to collect values / frequencies of values. Can often avoid the need for nested loops or
        O(n^2) operations with arrays and strings. CTD.</p>

    <h2>Multiple Pointers</h2>

    <p>Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, middle or end based on a certain condition. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.</p>

    <p>CTD. Very cool stuff.</p>

    <h2>Sliding Window Pattern</h2>
