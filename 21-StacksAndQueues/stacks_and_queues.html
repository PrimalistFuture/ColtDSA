    <h1>Stacks and Queues</h1>

    <h2>Stacks Intro</h2>

    <p>Abstract data structure in which the last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the
        stack. First In Last Out.</p>

    <p>The call stack is a stack, shockingly. Also think about the stack used in Magic or Legends of Runeterra. Undo /
        Redo. The back button in your browser.</p>

    <h2>Stack Implementation</h2>
    <p>There is more than one way to create a stack, because a stack really has only one rule: First In Last Out.</p>

    <p>Some programming languages come with their own stack data type. JavaScript does not. </p>

    <p>The easiest way to implement a stack is with an array. CTD. Works pretty darn well with push and pop. While you
        can also technically do it with unshift and shift, adding items to the beginning of an array is costly.</p>

    <p>But push and pop are O(1) so ezpz.</p>
