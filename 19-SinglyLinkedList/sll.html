    <h2>What is a Singly Linked List</h2>

    <p>An ordered list of data where the elements (known as nodes) only know their own value and the next value. SLL
        contains a head, tail and length property on the constructor.</p>

    <h2>SLL vs Array</h2>

    <p>If you wanted to change the first item in an array, you would have to reorganize every item. With a SLL, that is
        not necessary, because there are no indexes for the items. But as a consequence, random access is not allowed -
        you would have to traverse every node to find the one you want.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, everything a SLL can do, an array can do. But there are differences that matter. The main reason to
        use a SLL is that insertion and deletion is very easy.</p>
