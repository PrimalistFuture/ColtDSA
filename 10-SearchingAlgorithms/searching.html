    <h1>Searching Algorithms</h1>

    <h2>Intro to Linear Search</h2>

    <p>Works by checking every single element in the array and confirming if it is the value we want. O(n). Works just
        fine at low values of n, but therefore doesn't scale. If your data is not sorted and can't be sorted, this is
        the best way.</p>

    <p>indexOf, includes, find, findIndex all do linear search.</p>

    <h2>Binary Search</h2>

    <p>Represents a significant improvement over linear search. Rather than eliminating one element at a time, binary
        search eliminates half of the remaining elements at a time, BUT it only works on sorted arrays. O(log n). Nearly
        the same as linear at very small n values, but quickly gets wayyyy more efficient because that is how exponents
        (logs) work.</p>

    <p>Pick a pivot point in the middle, and check to see if the value you are looking for is less than or greater than
        the middle.</p>

    <h2>Naive String Search</h2>

    <p>This is not really what this thing is called, it doesn't have an official name. Searching for substrings in a
        larger string.</p>
