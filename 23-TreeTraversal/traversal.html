    <h1>Tree Traversal</h1>

    <p>Given any tree, even special ones, there are two main ways of tree traversal- <b>Breadth First Search</b> and
        <b>Depth First Search</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Breadth First Search</h2>

    <p>Starting from the beginning, BFS will look through the tree by generation. All of the children from any parent at
        a certain level, then all of their children, then all of their children and so on. Essentially goes along the
        x-axis across the tree.</p>

    <p>CTD. This is for Binary Tree, but doesn't have to be.</p>


    <h2>Depth First Search</h2>

    <p>Starting from the root node, DFS will look through down the y-axis first, visiting all of the nodes along the
        left side and then moving to the right for example.</p>

    <p>Unlike BFS, there are several DFS algorithms. We have a couple of options on how we want to show our data.</p>

    <p>The <b>PreOrder</b> algorithm will explore the entire left side before moving onto the right. </p>
