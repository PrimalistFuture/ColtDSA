    <h1>Radix Sort</h1>

    <p>The best possible time for a comparison sort (bubble, quick, merge, selection, insertion) is O(n log n). Except
        for Radix in edge cases.</p>

    <p>RadixSort works on numbers, and works a little differently. Exploits the fact that that information about the
        size of a number is encoded in the number of digits: the more digits, the bigger the number. </p>

    <p>Works by creating buckets for the ending digit of each number. Then the numbers are reordered based on that, and
        the process repeats for the second to last digit of the number. And so on. Never actually compares the numbers
        to each
        other.
    </p>

    <p>Time complexity is actually O(nk) where, n is the number of items, and k is the number of digits. Can be
        significantly better than a comparison sort in the right situation, which involves many duplicates. But even if
        there are no duplicate numbers, it is at worst O(n log n).</p>
