    <h1>Graphs</h1>

    <p>Super duper useful. Found everywhere on every social media site and it many other places.</p>

    <p>A <b>graph data structure</b> consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points,
        together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an <b>undirected</b> grap or a set of ordered pairs
        for a <b>directed</b> graph.
    </p>

    <h2>Uses for Graphs</h2>

    <p>As mentioned, they are everywhere. Social networks represent your friends as a graph. Wikipedia has a graph of
        all of the pages that link to each other. Map apps use graphs to store the cities and roads that connect them.
        Anytime something is recommend because other users liked it or bought it or searched for it, that data is
        usually stored as a graph.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Graphs</h2>

    <ul>Essential Graph Terms:
        <li>Vertex - Node, just like what a LinkedList or whatever have</li>
        <li>Edge - the connection between nodes</li>
        <li>Weighted - the value assigned to the edge connecting two nodes. Think like mph if the edge was a road and
            the nodes were cities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Undirected</b> Graphs has no direction (sometimes called polarity) between the edges. So the edge goes both
        ways. Friends on Facebook are undirected: they can see your shit, and you can see theirs.</p>

    <p><b>Directed</b> Graphs, by contrast, only go one specified direction. A -> B, but B can't go back to A.
        Apparently instagram followers are directed.
    </p>

    <h2>Storing Graphs</h2>

    <p>To represent graphs in code, we need to store the edges and the node. Because of the variability of the number of
        these, it is harder than something like a LinkedList.
    </p>

    <p>
        One such way is an <b>Adjacency Matrix</b>, which are usually arrays of arrays. Think like a gameboard, or a
        math matrix. Stores if there is an edge between any two nodes.
    </p>

    <p>The other main way is an <b>Adjacency List</b>. Similar, but now is each node has an array of its connected
        nodes. Usually an Array of objects where each node is a key, and its connections is an array.
    </p>

    <h2>Big O</h2>

    <p>Each option has its merits. Adjacency List is better for adding vertexs and edges, takes up less space, faster to
        iterate over, but slower to lookup a specific edge. Adjacency Matrix is better for lookup, but takes up more
        space especially in sparce graphs, and is slower to iterate over.
