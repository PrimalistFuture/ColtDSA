    <h1>Graphs</h1>

    <p>Super duper useful. Found everywhere on every social media site and it many other places.</p>

    <p>A <b>graph data structure</b> consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points,
        together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an <b>undirected</b> grap or a set of ordered pairs
        for a <b>directed</b> graph.
    </p>

    <h2>Uses for Graphs</h2>

    <p>As mentioned, they are everywhere. Social networks represent your friends as a graph. Wikipedia has a graph of
        all of the pages that link to each other. Map apps use graphs to store the cities and roads that connect them.
        Anytime something is recommend because other users liked it or bought it or searched for it, that data is
        usually stored as a graph.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Graphs</h2>

    <ul>Essential Graph Terms:
        <li>Vertex - Node, just like what a LinkedList or whatever have</li>
        <li>Edge - the connection between nodes</li>
        <li>Weighted - the value assigned to the edge connecting two nodes. Think like mph if the edge was a road and
            the nodes were cities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Undirected</b> Graphs has no direction (sometimes called polarity) between the edges. So the edge goes both
        ways. Friends on Facebook are undirected: they can see your shit, and you can see theirs.</p>

    <p><b>Directed</b> Graphs, by contrast, only go one specified direction. A -> B, but B can't go back to A.
        Apparently instagram followers are directed.</p>
