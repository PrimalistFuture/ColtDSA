    <h1>Data Structures</h1>

    <h2>What are Data Structures?</h2>

    <p>Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can
        be applied to the data.</p>

    <h2>Why are there so many?</h2>

    <p>Different DS excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more
        generally used.</p>

    <h2>Why should you care?</h2>

    <p>The more time you spend as a dev, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures. And you have
        already works with many data structures unknowingly.</p>

    <p>And they come up in interviews. Yay. Wow. But they do matter too.</p>

    <h2>Classes</h2>

    <p>We will be using classes for creating our data structures. Colt is going to be reviewing them. I am pretty
        confident, but I will stay here just in case I learn anything knew.</p>

    <p>Classes are made with the keyword class and a constructor function. CTD.</p>
