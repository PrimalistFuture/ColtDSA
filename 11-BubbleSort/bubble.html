    <h1>General Sort</h1>

    <p>Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (like an array) so that the items are in some
        kind of order. Sorting numbers, alpha, release year, revenue whatever.</p>

    <p>Part of the difficulty with sorting algorithms is that there are a bunch of them, and knowing when to use what is
        a major concern. Though most of them will, when used correctly, end up in the same place.</p>

    <p>Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it is good to know how it works. It is important to know what the
        built-in methods are doing behind the scenes and if you know what sorting technique they employ, you can know
        what they are good at and what they are bad at.</p>

    <p>Common interview topic, pog. Wow. So cool.</p>

    <p>There is no one size fits all algorithms, though some are generally better than others and some are more niche.

    <h2>Built-In JS .sort()</h2>

    <p>The built in JS .sort() method that can be called on arrays doesn't always work the way that you might expect.
        This is because it turns the array items into strings, then compares them. So things like numbers won't work
        like you would expect. But letters should.</p>

    <p>But we can actually specifiy how we want the method to behave. .sort() accepts an optional comparator function.
        The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), and determines their sort order based on their return value
        (a - b).</p>

    <p>If (a-b) returns a negative number, a should come before b (ascending order). If (a-b) returns a positive number,
        a should come after b (descending).</p>

    <p>You can define this comparator function normally or as an anonymous callback.</p>

    <p><b>CTD.</b></p>

    <h2>Bubble Sort</h2>

    <p>Not the most efficient, and not commonly used. But it is a good intro. <b>BubbleSort</b> is an algorithm where
        the largest values bubble to the top.</p>

    <p>Compares the next item to the current item. If the next is smaller than the current, than the items swap. If the
        items are in the correct order, they do not swap.</p>

    <p>After one pass, the largest value will have 'bubbled' to the top. The list then builds from the back.</p>

    <p>BubbleSort, and indeed many other sorting algorithms, involve some type of swapping functionality. That logic can
        be saved to a function and called when needed. CTD.</p>
