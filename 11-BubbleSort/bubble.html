    <h1>General Sort</h1>

    <p>Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (like an array) so that the items are in some
        kind of order. Sorting numbers, alpha, release year, revenue whatever.</p>

    <p>Part of the difficulty with sorting algorithms is that there are a bunch of them, and knowing when to use what is
        a major concern. Though most of them will, when used correctly, end up in the same place.</p>

    <p>Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it is good to know how it works. It is important to know what the
        built-in methods are doing behind the scenes and if you know what sorting technique they employ, you can know
        what they are good at and what they are bad at.</p>

    <p>Common interview topic, pog. Wow. So cool.</p>

    <p>There is no one size fits all algorithms, though some are generally better than others and some are more niche.
